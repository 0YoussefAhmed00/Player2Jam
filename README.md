# The Kael Paradox — Player2Jam

**The Kael Paradox** is an atmospheric action-adventure game where the player is a shadow spirit possessing the body of the fallen warrior Kael. Guided by Kael’s internal voice (powered by an LLM-like system), you explore a dark fantasy realm, solve memory puzzles, reclaim soul fragments, and confront the revenant general, Zarhakal, and the ultimate Soul Reaper.
